## Default Sturcture For Next Projects

### Structure info:

This structure is for projects that we don't want to use big libraries like `design systems libraries` and we want to create everything from scratch.

The structure is ready to use for :

- multiple languages with i18n
- default layout
- styled-components (ssr)

## Getting Started

First run `npm install` in command line and then you can run project with `npm run dev` command.
